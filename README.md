# Lilly's Adventures in Toyland.

Watching my 3 and a half year old daughter taking her first steps in gaming, I've been observing what she struggles with.
I feel there is a real gap for games that are playable by children not yet old enough to read, but beyond the simple activities
in gcompris's earlier levels.
More-over I'm a big fan of the idea of learning without knowing it - rather than setting out to teach a specific skill, I like
the idea of learning things just by playing. And if there is a skill worth learning from gaming, more than anything else, it's
simply how to solve puzzles. I've spent the past several days working on the idea in my head, and it's time to write it down.

So I have an idea for a game like that. Specifically designed with the idea that my daughter could play it, mostly on her own. 
Much of the design then, is dictated by the requirements thus imposed, but there is also an original idea. Rather than drawn graphics,
I want to use stop-motion sprites created from her own toys. This could be time-consuming but it isn't exceptionally hard to do, just photograph
the toys in various pozes (to the extent they are posable) in front of a solid green background that's easy to edit out. You don't need highly 
complicated animations after all. A simple two or three frame animation in each direction suffices for "walking". 

 ## Core design ideas:
- I think a semi-side-scrolling platformer like the original Super Mario Bros is the easiest to learn - but Mario (and games like SuperTux) 
  are still too complex, some things need to be reduced to fit a 3-year old's abilities.
- No jumping. Nothing time-based. The game should be slow, and not require fully developed spatial reasoning to play. It shouldn't rely on
  fast reflexes either. So all screens must be walkable, and the challenge should come from puzzles that are more about simple reasoning
  skills than speed.
- Controls should be simple. I think controller support is a must, but even then it should consider that the players have small hands 
  which struggle to reach the triggers and top buttons. So a very simple scheme - movement on the left joystick. Actions on the 4 buttons 
  (keyboard variants can be done - I'm not sure if keyboard + mouse is worthwhile, it's too reliant on fine motor skills that aren't quite
  there yet). Vertical movement should use ladders and slides, concept a three-year-old are already familiar with from the playground.
- Only four basic actions. For my game, I'm thinking spells. And you start with just one - more can be added over time as the child gets
  familiar with the idea. So a simple magical game, in a world of realistic looking toys - on a simple 2-d platform. It's not a nightmare
  to code, and the work can instead go to the art and level design. 
- Child-friendly content. Combat, if any, should  be on the "My little pony" level of violence only. Instead of a spell to set an enemy on 
  fire, I'd rather have spell to simply turn him into a harmless creature like a mouse, with some implication that the spell is temporary and
  will wear off sometime after safely leaving the area. While I subscribe to the theory that good fairy tales should teach children that monsters
  can be killed there is plenty of other ways to learn that, there should be space also to just have fun and learn to solve puzzles and maybe
  learn that not all monsters HAVE to be killed to be defeated. An equally important lesson.
- Backgrounds should reflect the regions the current set of characters derive from. Some of my African landscapes for levels using her 
  animal-toysets, thus teaching (very subtly) a simple bit of geography and the idea that different creatures live in different places.
  That said, there should be no shortage of fantasy here. This is learning through play - and I think imagination is far too important
  at that age to focus on realism beyond the scenes based on what is already real.
- Everything that is written must also be voiced (I'll need help here), including the opening menu etc. It must be navigatable by
  children who do not yet know how to read.
- A rock solid set of editing tools to allow parents to easily add new levels, and a way to share those levels so that everybody can 
  benefit. This would also allow the game to be much bigger than I could do on my own, and I could ask Caryn to help make some levels.
- These tools should give full access to the pre-existing assets and sprites, as well as an easy way to import your own. So level 
  design should be possible without knowing how to do green-screen stock-motion animation, but those who do, should be able to add
  new creatures.
- This rather rules out things like gamemaker or rpgmaker simply because they are too complex. While that is great if you want to 
  create your own game for older audiences, it is overwhelming to a three-year old.
- I've set out to create games before, and never finished them because it was too much work on a busy working parent's schedule
  so on this one I'm setting out also to make the work-load manageable, partly by making as much as possible creation accessible
  to other people. On the other hand I have successfully finished a game as well (tappytux long ago), and part of why it worked
  was that it's major additional content could be crowdsourced - there were wordlists in dozens of languages at it's height -
  and the coding was written in such a way that, once the engine was completed, only bugfixes and optimization was needed - new
  additions did not require new code. That's a design imperitive now i think (it also helped that, at the time, this was done
  as part of my job and on company time)
- Code should be available however, so parents who can code can make modifications, improvements and customizations for their
  own kids unique needs, and be freely share-able afterwards. The code will be GPL'd however. While I understand this is 
  unpopular in the gaming community, I want everybody to benefit from every improvement. I am happy to put the artwork
  under a more liberal MIT license and use MIT-licenses art from other people.
- I want the game accessible to as wide an audience as possible, so I intend to use a donation/pay-what-you-want model, 
  which means   you can get it for free if you don't have money available. A bit of money from those who can make it would be 
  great   but I'm not doing this to make money, I'm doing it to create something for my child. And, in the humble-bundle
  approach, half of any income recieved will go to a children's charity.
- As she ages, more advanced versions introducing new skill requirements would be cool to add. So that a 5-year-old would
  be able to enjoy their own adventure, which is challenging on their level. These could be level-packs, or require a
  more advanced engine. That's something for the future. 

I'm sure more ideas will come out as I start working on the game. But these are the thoughts currently in my head. I 
wanted to write them down, and get feedback from fellow coders, parents and friends to expand on this before I start
writing code and taking a whole lot of pictures of toys :P I'll incorporate the ideas I like (and consider how many likes a
comment gets as votes for the idea) and then start working on the actual code.  

PS. I will gladly accept volunteers who wish to help with any part of this. If you're hoping to get rich it's the wrong
project, I don't know if it will make anything, but if it does, I'll share the income fairly with any contibutors.
